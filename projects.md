## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis of Movies Data in Python

<span style="color:darkblue"> <em>Python, numpy, pandas, matplotlib</em></span>

#### Project description:

The aim of the project is to explore data and build model to predict rating of particular movies. Project is based on Movies Dataset accessible on Kaggle.com [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset). Used file movies_metadata.csv contains information on 45_000 movies released on or before July 2017. Movies belong to the Full MovieLens Dataset. Variables include budget, revenue, release dates, languages, and more. Ratings are on a scale of 1-10.

Project contains Jupyter Notebook file named "movies_case_eda.ipynb" with:
* Data collection <br>
* General overview <br>
* Data exploration of choosen variables <br>

#### To do:
* Explore relations between variables <br>
* Create movies_case_feat_eng.ipynb where features will be prepared for data modelling <br>
* Create movies_case_model.ipynb for data modelling <br>
* Deploy model in Flask web app <br>

## 2. Credit Scoring in R    

<span style="color:darkblue"> <em> R, MXNetR, dplyr, scorecard, corrplot, fastDummies </em></span>

#### Project description:

The aim of the project is to predict defaults of bank customers. Project contains two files: "feature-engineering.R" and "credit-scoring.R".

In feature engineering part there are used techniques like:
* IV (Information Value) calculating
* dummy variables
* merging correlated variables with PCA

In credit scoring part following activities were done:
* setting up Multi Layer Perceptron
* creating custom callback function for training process monitoring
* model evaluation with gini coefficient
<br>

## 3. Migrations in Europe Visualization in Shiny App    

<span style="color:darkblue"> <em> R, Shiny, googleCharts, magrittr, devtools </em></span>

#### Project description:

The aim of the project is to build simple web application to visualize migrations across Europe over the years.
Application frontend consists an interactive chart showing changes in migrants and refugees levels in European countries. Small button below the chart may be used to animate changes over the years. 
In the chart it is possible to discover:
* particular country names in the map represented as bubbles
* population of particular country at the choosen moment in time represented as a bubble size
* migrants and refugees level at the choosen moment in time represented as a position in 2-dimensional space
* color division on northern, southern, eastern and western countries
